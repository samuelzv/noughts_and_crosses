# Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

# Goal
The goal of this repo is to implement a web app with Angular Dart and the mobile version using Flutter, tyring to share among them as much code as possible using the bloc pattern.

The bloc behaviour was implemented using the [bloc](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bloc) library
